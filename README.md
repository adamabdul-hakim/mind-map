# Interactive Mind Map — Axiomatic Systems & Incidence Geometry

An interactive mind map covering Chapter 2 of Foundations of Geometry by Gerad Venema. Click to progressively explore topics — starting from the center and expanding outward through branches and sub-topics with animated connections.

## Topics Covered

- **2.1 Structure** — Undefined terms, definitions, axioms, theorems, models
- **2.2 Incidence Geometry** — 3 axioms, finite/infinite models, isomorphism
- **2.3 Parallel Postulates** — Euclidean, elliptic, hyperbolic
- **2.4 Real World** — Greek vs modern views, big questions, power of abstraction

## How It Works

1. The center card appears on load
2. Click it to reveal the four main branches
3. Click any branch to expand its detail cards
4. Click again to collapse

## Tech

HTML · CSS · JavaScript — no dependencies.
